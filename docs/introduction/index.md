# Utilajo

## What is Utilajo?

Utilajo (the Esperanto word for "utility") is a monorepo that contains common utility functions used by me that you probably won't use. I created this documentation to make my repository more organized and for my self in a few months or years to understand **"WHAT CODE IS THIS??"**. All kidding aside though, if something interests you and you think, “Hmm, I should use this”, feel free to use it. This repository consists of utility types, general utility functions, and data generator functions.

Utilajo is designed to be used in different types of projects, from frontend React website projects to backend tests but some functions is totally designed for my personal purposes.

## Why you should use Utilajo?

**I really don't know why, but i don't want discourage you. Make a experiment, use some Utilajo functions that interest you. and if you really liked this... so why not?**

## How this docs works?

This documentation is divided into several sections that represent the packages. Each section is about a single package, and the purpose of this is to provide independent and easy search access to the packages that you want to explore. See [Packages](/packages/) to see the list of packages.
