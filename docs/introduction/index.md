# Utilajo

## What is Utilajo?

Utilajo (the Esperanto word for "utility") is a monorepo that contains common utility functions used by me, functions that you probably won't use. I created this [documentation](http://localhost:5173) to make my repository more organized, and for my future self, in a few months or years, to understand **"WHAT CODE IS THIS??"** All kidding aside, if something interests you and you think, “Hmm, I should use this,” feel free to use it. This repository consists of utility types, general utility functions, and data generator functions.

Utilajo is designed to be used in different types of projects, from frontend React website projects to backend tests, although some functions are specifically designed for my personal use.

## Why you should use Utilajo?

**I really don't know why, but I don't want to discourage you. Go ahead, experiment with some Utilajo functions that interest you, and if you really like it... then why not?**

## How this docs works?

This documentation is divided into several sections that represent the packages. Each section is about a single package, and the purpose of this is to provide independent and easy access to the packages you want to explore. Refer to the [Packages](/packages/) section to see the list of packages.
